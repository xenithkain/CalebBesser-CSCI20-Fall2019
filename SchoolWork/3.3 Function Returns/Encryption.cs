//This code will take a string of letters and encrypt them using the Ceaser Cypher. Then if you want you can take that string and decrypt it.


//Main Function
//First ill ask if they want to decrypt or encrypt.
//If the want to encrypt, it will take the string input from the user, then it will convert that into an array of seperate letters to work with.
//Then i will call the encrypt function. It will output the encrypted string.
//If they want to decrypt it will do the same but in the decrypt function it will reverse it.



//Encrypt Function
//This will take the array of letters as an input.
//Then it will cycle through the array, then it will compare each letter in the array to a base array it has hard coded. It will use this to change each letter a certain numbers of letters down.
//Then i will return the newly changed array.


//Decrypt Function
//This will take the array of letters as an input.
//Then it will do the same as the Encrypt array but it will do the reverse, it will move each letter back a certain number of times.
//Then it will return the newly changed array.
