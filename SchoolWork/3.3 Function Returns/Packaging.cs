//This code will take the dimensions of a drinking class from a text file, then it will calculate how big the box needs and how heavy it will be.


//Main Function
//Here i will open a stream to get the file then i will read through the file to get the numbers for the glass. Ill probably assign these to variables, so i could change them if i wanted to.
//Then i will call the the packaging function wich will take the dimensions from the text doc and will do a calc to see how many will fit.
//Then i will output the size and weight.



//Packaging Function
//Input is going to be the dimensions of the glasses.
//Then it will find the area of all the glasses right next to each other. Basically a cube. Then it will add up all the the cups weight.
//Then i will return the weight and size.
