//This code will take people election votes and use structs to figure out who won.



//Struct Vote
//Each vote will have 3 electorates, and points for each. So a total of 6 traits.
//I will assign these values in the Main function.




//Main Function
//This function will take the inputs for the vote from the user. Then it will assign them to the vote struct.
//Then i will use the count up function to figure out who won, taking the given votes.
//Then i will output the winner.


//Points_Per_Place function
//This will take the traits of each vote given. Then it will assign each electorate the amount of points they got overall.
//Then it will output the electorate with the most points.
//This will be given to the Main function.

//Approval_rating function
//This will take the traits of each vote given. Then it will check how many times that name was second or first, and gives them a point.
//Then it adds the points up and outputs that name.
//This output will be in the main function.

//Winner_Takes_All function
//This will take the traits of each vote given. Then it will see how many times that name was first, and assign it a point for each.
//Then it takes whoever has the most and outputs that.
//This output will be in the main function.
